# hrftex
Templates for lecture notes, excercises, homework

## Installation (for MikTeX)
Download the source code and put the folder hrftex in a 
[local texmf tree](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/69483/create-a-local-texmf-tree-in-miktex), 
then refresh the MikTeX filename database (see also [How can I manually install a package on MiKTeX (Windows)](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/2066/197635), under Installing sty or cls files)

## Snippets for VS Code
If you are using Visual Studio Code to work on the LaTeX in this repository, I recommend forking (or just downloading) my [LaTeX snippets designed to be used with this package](https://github.com/r0uv3n/latex_snippets).
