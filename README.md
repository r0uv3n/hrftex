<!-- Uploaded to CTAN for ease of access by e.g. tutors. -->

## Installation
<!-- ### Via CTAN
This package is available on CTAN as [hrftex](https://ctan.org/pkg/hrftex), but this version may be severely outdated. -->

### Installation via GitHub (for MikTeX)

Download the source code and put the folder hrftex in a
[local texmf tree](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/69483/create-a-local-texmf-tree-in-miktex),
then refresh the MikTeX filename database (see also [How can I manually install a package on MiKTeX (Windows)](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/2066/197635), under Installing sty or cls files).

## Example Usage

If you're a member of the Georg-August-University Göttingen you can view my lecture notes (for the course "Geometry Processing 2") taken with this package - as well as the code used to compile them - [here](https://gitlab.gwdg.de/henryruben.fischer/geometry-processing-2-lecture-notes) on the universities' GitLab.

Older versions of `hrftex` were used to compile my (german) "Analytische Geometrie und Lineare Algebra 2" lecture notes (code [here](https://gitlab.gwdg.de/henryruben.fischer/Vorlesungsmitschrift-AGLA-2)) and my "Differenzial- und Integralrechnung 2" lecture notes (code [here](https://gitlab.gwdg.de/henryruben.fischer/Vorlesungsmitschrift-DIFF-2))

## Snippets for VS Code

If you are using Visual Studio Code to work on the LaTeX in this repository, I recommend forking (or just downloading) my [LaTeX snippets designed to be used with this package](https://github.com/r0uv3n/latex_snippets).
